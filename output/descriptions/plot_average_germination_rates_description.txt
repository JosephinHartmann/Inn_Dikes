# Analysis: Average Germination Rate per Sown Plot

## Overview
This analysis calculates the expected average germination rate for each sown plot by combining:
1. Species-level germination rates from laboratory tests (germination_rate_100)
2. Species composition ratios for each plot (from Inn_Dike_species.csv)

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Species germination rates**: `output/germination_rates_per_species.csv`
  - Contains germination_rate_100 for each species (calculated from 4 petri dishes: 2 from AB campaign + 2 from CD campaign)
- **Plot species composition**: `data/raw/Inn_Dike_species.csv`
  - Contains species ratios (proportions) for each plot
  - Metadata: pool (r1a, r22), trait_constraint (high, low), seedmix_type, timepoint, year

### Calculation Method
For each plot, the average germination rate is calculated as:
```
avg_germination_rate = sum(species_ratio × germination_rate_100) / sum(species_ratios)
```

This is a **weighted average**, where each species' germination rate is weighted by its proportion in the seed mix.

### Filtering
- Only plots with `year == 0` (seeded plots) are included
- Only species with available `germination_rate_100` are used in calculations
- Plots with no matching species will have `NA` for avg_germination_rate

## Results

### Output Files
- `output/plot_average_germination_rates.csv`: Main results table with:
  - Plot metadata (id_plot, pool, trait_constraint, seedmix_type, timepoint, year)
  - avg_germination_rate: Calculated weighted average germination rate
  - n_species_matched: Number of species in plot that had germination rate data
  - total_ratio_matched: Sum of ratios for matched species (shows coverage)

### Figures
- `figures/germination_rate_by_pool.png`: Boxplot comparing germination rates between pools (r1a vs r22)
- `figures/germination_rate_by_seedmix_type.png`: Boxplot comparing germination rates across seed mix types

## Interpretation Notes

- The germination rates represent **expected** germination based on laboratory tests
- Actual field germination may differ due to environmental factors
- Plots with higher species diversity in the seed mix may have more robust germination rates
- Differences between pools or seed mix types may reflect:
  - Species composition differences
  - Inherent germination capacity of selected species
  - Seed quality and viability

## Next Steps / Questions to Explore

1. Compare expected vs. observed germination rates in the field
2. Analyze relationship between avg_germination_rate and:
   - Substrate depth
   - Biomass production
   - Species richness in established communities
3. Investigate which species contribute most to plot-level germination rates
4. Assess whether trait constraints (high vs. low) affect germination success
