Figure: est_subs_pool_functional

Description:
Establishment rate by substrate depth, separated by species pool (R1A vs R22) and functional type (high vs low SLA). Shows mean establishment with standard error bars across different substrate depths.

Details:
- X-axis: Substrate depth (cm)
- Y-axis: Mean establishment rate with standard error bars
- Colors: Species pool (R1A, R22)
- Linetype/Shape: Functional type (high SLA, low SLA)
- Analysis: Linear model with standard error bars
