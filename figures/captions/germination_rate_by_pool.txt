Figure: germination_rate_by_pool

Description:
Boxplot showing the distribution of average germination rates per plot across different species pools (r1a and r22). Each plot represents a sown plot with its calculated average germination rate based on the weighted species composition and individual species germination rates from germination tests.

Details:
Data source: Calculated from species germination rates (germination_rate_100) weighted by species ratios in each plot.
Number of plots: r1a = 48, r22 = 48
Filtered for: year == 0 (seeded plots only)
Method: Weighted average germination rate = sum(species_ratio × germination_rate_100) for all species in plot
